# macOS Cybersecurity Handbook

Currently, Apple is in the process of transitioning their (computer) devices from using Intel based hardware to custom ARM based Apple Silicon. Even before this process Apple had been integrating other custom hardware modules into their machines. Given the large amount of infromation this would require encompassing and due to my desire for this guide to remain as up-to-date as possible initially this guide will only reference Apple's latest hardware configurations. As the guide progresses in completion older platforms/hardware will be added as well. To learn what configurations are currently covered by this guide see the [supported hardware](#supported-hardware) section

## Installing macOS

By default Apple devices come with macOS already pre-installed on them. Depending on your [security posture](#security-posture) it maybe acceptable to use the machine as is with this default setup and simply go through the intial configuration. Otherwise, it may make more sense to overwrite this install with a brand new installation of the operating system. This section will cover these different scenarios
